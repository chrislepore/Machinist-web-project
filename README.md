Machinist Sales Website
=======================
********************************************************************************************************

Description
-----------

This project creates a sales website for a CNC machine shop. This website is a place for engineers to create a CNC part that includes a name, material, schematic(link), and finishing. Then an order can be placed for multiple parts which will create a payment form for the order. This app is not complete. For future versions, there will be a way to pay for orders, parts can be included in more than 1 order, the schematic of a part will include images instead of a link, parts can be deleted, and orders can be placed/edited/viewed. There will also be a list of parts of that is offered by the company, current prices for materials, and other details about the machinist economy.

In this website a user currently can:
* register, login, view, edit, and delete a account
* create, view, and edit a part
